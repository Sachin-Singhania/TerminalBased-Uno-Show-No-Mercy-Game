🃏 UNO: Show No Mercy – Game Rules
UNO: Show No Mercy is a custom twist on the classic UNO game with extreme cards and aggressive mechanics. The objective remains the same: Be the first player to get rid of all your cards. Here's how the game works:

🎯 Objective
Be the first to play all your cards.

The game supports 2–6 players.

🛠️ Setup
Each player is dealt 7 cards.

A card is placed in the center to start the game (the "current card").

Remaining cards form the draw pile; played cards go into the playing stack.

The game starts in a clockwise direction.

🧩 Card Types and Their Effects
🔢 Number Cards (0–9)
Must match the color or number of the current card.

🔁 Reverse
Reverses play direction (clockwise ↔ counter-clockwise).

⏭️ Skip
Skips the next player's turn.

⏹️ Skip Everyone
Skips all other players for one turn — your turn comes again.

➕ Draw Cards
Draw2: Next player draws 2 cards and loses a turn.

Draw4: Next player draws 4 cards and loses a turn.

Draw6: Next player draws 6 cards.

Draw10: Next player draws 10 cards — a true "No Mercy" moment!

Draw4Reverse: Next player draws 4 cards and play direction is reversed.

🎲 Wild Roulette (Color: BLACK)
Current player declares a color.

Next player keeps drawing until they get a card of the declared color.

🧨 DiscardAll
Discard all cards of the same color from your hand.

🚫 ZeroPass
Play passes to the next player, skipping your turn — strategic for blocking wins.

🔁 SevenPass
Reverses direction and skips a turn — chaos guaranteed!

🚦 Valid Moves
You can play a card if:

It matches the color or type of the current card.

It is a wild card (e.g. WildRoulette).

DiscardAll can be played if the color matches.

You cannot play cards with unmatched color/type unless it's a wild.

🧑‍⚖️ Special Rules
UNO: You do not need to call UNO; the game handles it automatically.

Win Condition: You win immediately when you play your last card.

Deck Recycle: If draw pile is low, 80% of the playing stack is shuffled back.

No Mercy Rule: Some cards can completely change the game in a single move.

Chaining: Some cards like DiscardAll can trigger chains if same color cards remain.

🏁 End of Game
The game ends when a player runs out of cards.

A leaderboard may track eliminated players.
